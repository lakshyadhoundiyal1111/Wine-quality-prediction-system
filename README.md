#Wine Quality Prediction System

Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. The system provides insights into the relationship between wine characteristics and quality.

Dataset
The project utilizes the Wine Quality Dataset, containing 12 physicochemical attributes and quality scores for red and white Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines.

- Attributes:
    - Fixed acidity
    - Volatile acidity
    - Citric acid
    - Residual sugar
    - Chlorides
    - Free sulfur dioxide
    - Total sulfur dioxide
    - Density
    - pH
    - Sulphates
    - Alcohol
- Quality Scores: ranging from 3 to 9

Features
- Predicts wine quality scores based on physicochemical properties
